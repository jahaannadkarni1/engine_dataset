# Engine Dataset
* Analysis of Remaining Usage Life (RUL) of Airplane Engines; Performed Machine Learning & Data Wrangling
* Assisted Prof. Changyue Song on Large Datasets to build Machine Learning Models to support RUL outcomes
* Organized dataset using wrangling tools such as Python Pandas, NumPy, SciKit-Learn to reduce data redundancy
* Conducted feature engineering to reduce dimensionality for better performance of model by 27%
* Designed graphs and correlation matrix using Matplotlib to visually analyze data; decreased idle time by 12%
* Utilized functions to find the RUL, decreasing repetitive tasks by a major 80% focusing more on the data quality 
* Built a Report on the current progress of the project with visualizations and inferential insights from the data
